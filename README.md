STORY ---- There is a planet Javis. They are more advance then us. They now want to rule on our planet earth but did you want to be ruled by them. No na, then we have to fight with them but this will not be easy because they have more powerful and advance weapon and spaceship then us so good luck to you and make sure you win. :)

NPC----Javis' player (Spaceship).

RULES----We can control spaceship by pressing A and D or left and right arrow key.

ADAPTAVITY----From earth we have only one spaceship and from Javis side we have multiple spaceship to destroy our spaceship and we will also try to destroy their spaceship.
